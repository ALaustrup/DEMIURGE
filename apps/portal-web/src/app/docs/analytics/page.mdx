# Profile Analytics

Profile Analytics provides comprehensive insights into your contribution to the Demiurge network. Access your analytics dashboard at `/analytics` after logging in via "My Void".

## Overview

The analytics dashboard shows:

- **On-Chain Metrics**: Your Syzygy score, level, CGT balance, transactions, and NFTs
- **Chat & Social Metrics**: Message activity, rooms created, media shared
- **Contribution Breakdown**: How your activities contribute to your total network impact score
- **Activity Timeline**: Visual chart of your message activity over the last 30 days

## On-Chain Metrics

### Syzygy Score

Your Syzygy score measures your contribution to the network through:
- Seeding and serving other creators' content
- Network participation
- Content distribution

Higher Syzygy scores lead to:
- Automatic level-ups
- CGT rewards (10 CGT per level)
- Badge achievements (e.g., "Luminary" at 10,000+ Syzygy)

### Leveling System

Levels are calculated based on your Syzygy score using a quadratic progression:
- **Level Threshold**: BASE × level² (where BASE = 1,000)
- **Level 1**: 0 Syzygy (starting level)
- **Level 2**: 4,000 Syzygy
- **Level 3**: 9,000 Syzygy
- **Level 4**: 16,000 Syzygy
- And so on...

Each time you level up, you automatically receive **10 CGT** as a reward.

### CGT Metrics

- **Balance**: Your current CGT wallet balance
- **Earned from Rewards**: Total CGT you've earned from level-up rewards
- **Transaction Count**: Total number of on-chain transactions

### NFT Ownership

See how many D-GEN NFTs you own. NFTs are displayed in your "My Void" dashboard.

### Archon Status

- Mint D-GEN NFTs
- List NFTs in the Abyss marketplace

## Chat & Social Metrics

### Message Statistics

- **Total Messages**: All messages sent across World Chat, DMs, and custom rooms
- **World Chat**: Messages in the global public chat
- **Direct Messages**: Private messages sent to other users
- **Custom Room Messages**: Messages in user-created rooms

### Community Building

- **Rooms Moderated**: Number of rooms where you have moderator privileges
- **Media Shared**: Number of images/videos you've shared in chat

### Activity Timeline

The message activity chart shows your daily message count over the last 30 days, helping you visualize your engagement patterns.

- **Syzygy Contribution**: 1 point per Syzygy point
