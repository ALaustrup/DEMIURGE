# Creators Handbook

A comprehensive guide for Archons (creators) on Demiurge.

## Becoming an Archon

Archons are UrgeID users who have "ascended" to creator status. Archons have special privileges:

- **Mint D-GEN NFTs**: Create and mint AI-native NFTs
- **List in Abyss**: Sell NFTs in the marketplace
- **Earn CGT**: Receive royalties and rewards
- **Creator Economy**: Participate in the full creator ecosystem

### Current Status

Currently, Archon status is granted manually or through special events. The Genesis Archon is pre-funded and marked as an Archon during chain initialization.

**Future**: Archon status may be earned through:
- High Syzygy scores
- Community contributions
- Special achievements
- Governance participation

## Minting D-GEN NFTs

D-GEN NFTs are AI-native, provenance-rich NFTs that can be minted by Archons.

### NFT Structure

Each D-GEN NFT includes:

- **`fabric_root_hash`**: Reference to Fabric content (64-character hex string)
- **`forge_model_id`**: Optional AI model identifier
- **`forge_prompt_hash`**: Optional AI prompt hash
- **`royalty_recipient`**: Optional royalty recipient address
- **`royalty_bps`**: Royalty percentage in basis points (0-10000, where 10000 = 100%)

### Minting via RPC

Use the `cgt_mintDgenNft` RPC method:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "cgt_mintDgenNft",
  "params": {
    "owner": "YOUR_ARCHON_ADDRESS",
    "fabric_root_hash": "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "forge_model_id": null,
    "forge_prompt_hash": null,
    "name": "My NFT Name",
    "description": "NFT description"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

**Requirements**:
- The `owner` address must be an Archon
- `fabric_root_hash` must be a valid 64-character hex string (32 bytes)

### Minting via Portal

1. Go to your "My Void" dashboard (`/urgeid`)
2. Navigate to the NFT section
3. Click "Mint Test NFT" (dev mode) or use the minting interface
4. Enter NFT details and submit

## Listing NFTs in Abyss

The Abyss marketplace allows Archons to list their D-GEN NFTs for sale.

### Listing Process

1. **Prepare Your NFT**: Ensure your NFT is minted and you own it
2. **Set Price**: Choose a price in CGT
3. **Set Royalties**: Configure royalty percentage (0-100%)
4. **List**: Submit listing transaction

### Royalties

Royalties are paid to the `royalty_recipient` address (or creator if not set) on every secondary sale:

- **Royalty Basis Points**: 0-10000 (0% to 100%)
- **Example**: 500 bps = 5% royalty
- **Automatic**: Royalties are automatically distributed on sale

### Marketplace Features

### 1. NFT Sales

- **Primary Sales**: Receive full sale price when selling your NFTs
- **Royalties**: Earn a percentage on every secondary sale
